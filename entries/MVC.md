# MVC

**Model View Controller** (usually known as MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.

Traditionally used for desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs), this pattern has become popular for designing web applications.
Popular programming languages like [Python](/wiki/Python),Perl, Ruby, PHP, Java, Swift, and Elixir have MVC frameworks that are used for web or mobile application development straight out of the box.
